NOTE: Before you enter any files into the product_photo_inbox you must fill a column with your credentials inside the PVC Input Documentation Log. The link to this is inside the product_photo_inbox.
Put files here with the filenames like "[full upc]_front" "[full upc]_side" "[full upc]_back." 
These will be automatically added to the correct page on the website by the PVC process.

Examples: 
0196786217685_front
0196786217685_back
0196786217685_side
0196786217685_angle

Notes:
- UPCs must be the complete UPC as used on the purchasing sheet, not the Walmart shortened version of the UPC.
- Windows adds the file extension (.jpg) to the end of the filename automatically.  If you have filenames set to be shown on your computer, do not edit them out.
